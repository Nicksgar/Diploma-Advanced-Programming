NOTES:

The self Parameter:

Imagine you’re baking cookies. Each cookie is like an object, and the recipe (class) tells you how to make them.
When you follow the recipe, you need to know which cookie you’re working with. That’s where self comes in.
self is like a label that says, “Hey, I’m working on this specific cookie!” It helps methods (steps in the recipe) know which cookie they’re dealing with.

Why Do We Need self?

Without self, methods wouldn’t know which cookie to work on. They’d be lost!
By including self as a parameter, we make sure methods can access the right cookie’s ingredients (attributes) and perform actions (methods) on it.

Private Attributes:

Imagine you have secret cookie ingredients (attributes) that you don’t want others to see.

To keep them private, you can put them in a hidden box (class) and lock it.

In Python, we use a single underscore (_) to say, “This ingredient is private, don’t mess with it!”

Double underscores (__) make it even more secret (like a double lock).

So, self helps methods work with specific cookies, and private attributes keep our secret ingredients safe! 🍪🔒
