In this code:

We have a Player class to store player information.

We create a Node class to represent each element in the doubly linked list. Each Node object stores a Player object and has pointers to the next and previous nodes.

The DoublyLinkedList class manages the list. It has methods to append players to the list and print the list.
We create an instance of DoublyLinkedList and add Player objects to it.

The print_list method traverses the list from the head to the tail, printing the player details.
